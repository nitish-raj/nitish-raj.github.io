:::{#hero-heading}

I am an engineering professional with 8+ years of experience in delivering advanced solutions that drive business growth. I’m skilled in using development tools like Docker, Git, and dbt, and I write code using Python, R, SQL, and PySpark. My work often involves using cloud services, particularly within AWS and GCP.

I use analytics alongside creativity to make sure that business intelligence tools like Tableau, QuickSight, and Power BI provide insights that can be acted upon, not just data.

In my professional journey, I've always been keen to learn more and work well with my team. This has helped me handle complex projects and make a notable difference. I like to connect the technical side of things with the business side, and I take pride in leading and mentoring. I believe in using the latest tools and a curious mind to find the story in the data.

I’m always ready to bring new ideas to life, and I welcome the chance to connect with fellow data professionals and industry leaders as we build the future together.

If you like to collaborate or need my help, [Lets' Talk](letstalk.qmd).
